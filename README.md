# Budget-App
A project that I've built on my JavaScript learning path. This app calculates monthly income and expenses based on the added values.

You can try it out at: <a href="https://mindaras.github.io/budget_app/" target="_blank">https://mindaras.github.io/budget_app/</a>

*Please note that this app is made for desktop screens only.
